# Vision-par-ordinateur-SII  OpenCV-Basic-Functions-and-Processing
 This repository contains a series of practical exercises (TPs) focused on fundamental image processing and computer vision techniques using OpenCV. The tasks cover various aspects such as image manipulation, filtering, thresholding, color processing, and video handling. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with essential image processing methods that are foundational for more advanced computer vision projects.

## Tasks Overview:

### TP1 - Basic OpenCV Functions:
- Introduction to OpenCV functions such as `imread()`, `imshow()`, `cvtColor()`, etc.
- Loading and displaying images.

### TP2 - Histograms:
- Understanding and calculating image histograms.
- Visualizing histograms for grayscale and color images.

### TP3 - Smoothing (Mean and Median Filters):
- Applying smoothing filters (mean and median) to images.
- Exploring how these filters help in reducing noise.

### TP4 - Binarization & Thresholding:
- Converting images to binary using different thresholding techniques (`cv2.threshold()`, `cv2.adaptiveThreshold()`).
- Understanding the importance of thresholding for segmentation.

### TP5 - Convolution Filters:
- Applying various convolution filters to perform edge detection, sharpening, etc.
- Exploring kernel applications in OpenCV.

### TP6 - Morphological Filters:
- Applying morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing for image preprocessing.

### TP7 - Color and Conversion:
- Understanding color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV).
- Converting between different color spaces using OpenCV.

### TP8 - Video Reading and Writing:
- Reading and writing video streams using OpenCV.
- Understanding how to capture and display video frames.
